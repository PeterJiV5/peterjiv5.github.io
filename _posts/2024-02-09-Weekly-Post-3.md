This is now my third weekly post, keep it up!

# Rust
Recently I've been trying to learn the Rust programming language, and it has not only grown my Rust knowledge, but also my C skills.
A lot of the common programming practices for Rust, in my opinion, are adopted from C, after a long time that programmers have suffered from tedious memory management.
The memory management concepts in Rust help me to write better C code.
I have a Rust compiler running for my C code in my head most of the time now :P

# Podcast
I spend a lot of time on the road each week: 3+ hours in the commute, 5 hours walking the dog.
For safety reason, I can't read or watch anything during these many hours. So I either listen to music or podcasts.

While music is great and relaxing (I should do critical listening more often), I need to obsorb more information.
Podcasts come in really handy. There are great podcasters where you can "talk" to famous people with no cost at all.

There are some podcasts that I really love:
- Lex Fridman (I may have mis-spelled)
- The Wolf Sound
- Rustacean Station

I do hope that this list will grow.
