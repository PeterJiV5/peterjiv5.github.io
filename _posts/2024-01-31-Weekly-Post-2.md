This is the first post of the new Weekly series where I log at least three important things of a week.

# Career Advice
[A very good blog](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) on the essence of the software engineering profession.
The core idea of this blog is that, you need to be able to display your value. 

You get hired because you can reduce cost or increase profit. That's it.
No one is your friend, and this is just a business. 

# Prune My Life
As the title suggests, I decided to prune some branches of my life.
The pruned branches include: badminton, audio engineering, interesting stuff, and myself.

I always had a strong concious of myself. Such as who I am, what I want to achieve, etc.
But apparently, these things are not compatible with a marriage.
I don't really have a chance to do what I love, and I become mad and even depressed about it.

What did I do? I started many fights with my wife, and things don't get better. And they will not.

So, I decided to get rid of those things that I deeply love, and just ***be***.

# Books: Positive Discipline, Thinking: Fast and Slow
## Positive Discipline
## Thinking: Fast and Slow
Some points illustrated in the book seems opposite to what I think.
But maybe I am viewing it from the perspective a reader.
If I was given tests without knowing its underlying purpose, I might behave just like the testants.
