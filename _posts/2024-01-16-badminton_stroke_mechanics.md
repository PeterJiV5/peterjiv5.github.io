# Mechanics of Badminton Strokes
In this article, we'll discuss how a badminton stroke is executed, including forehand and backhand strokes. 
## What strokes are there?
There are many types of strokes that a player can play during a game. Most of them can be executed in both forehand and backhand scenarios. A slightly different case exists for around-the-head area, where the arm's motion is similar to forehand's but the body's not. 
Strokes can be categorized based on the spacial alighnemnt with the body. 
On the Z-axis (vertically), there are the following types: upper-hand, mid-hand and lower-hand.
On the Y-axis (front-to-back court), there are front-, cross- and behind-body shots.
And on the X-axis (left-to-right), we have the forehand and backhand shots. (Plus around-the-head)

As human automany has determined how our arms extends and rotates, on the three axis, all shot can be classified as aggresive, neutral and defensive shots.
Aggresive shots usually have more explosive power; the shuttle speed is faster and the landing position control is more precise.
Defensive shots are slower, give more time for the opponent to react and harder to control.
Neutral shots are in between.  

At the front of the court, large arm/hand motions can generate high lifts. Small arm/hand motions can generate push and drop shots.
At the middle of the court, drives (fast and flat shots) require more power from the body and the arm, and drop shots usually only need finger power.
At the back of the court, all shots require proper hitting techniques, but the drop shot do not need as much and require more control from the fingers.
## Forehand
The forehand hitting motion is based on the forearm's *pronation* (palm turning downwards). This generates the most power and thus accelerate the racket the fastest.
As opposed to some common beliefs that the power comes from the wrist or fingers, the pronation motion generates the most power, and the fingers merely act as a leverage to deliver that power.
The finger techniques are very important, since it is the last link in the dynamic chain, but the generator is actually the forearm.

The forearm motion part of the swing starts with the preparation stance.

In this stance, the racket faces the net. Notice that the forearm is actually twisted inwards, otherwise the racket would be facing sideways.
Although some professional players do prepare the swing with the racket facing outwards, we will discuss this in a moment.
When raising the elbow, the racket head's inertia will draw the forearm further inwards, thus performing a slight supination.
This motion stores energy for the pronation that will take place in a moment, and is a critical phase of the swing.
A common problem with amatuer players is that this motion is often weakened by using too much upper arm.

At the next stage of the swing, as the elbow is fixed, the forearm extends and pronates.
This will generate a lot of power and put the racket to the right direction.
The racket ends at a position where the forearm is back at the neutral position.
Which means that the forearm is not twisted in any direction.
This relaxed position ensures that the most energy is released into the racket (thus the shuttle), and it is crucial for the timing to be right.
Good timing makes sure that the max momentum is transfer to the shuttle at the position where the forearm is most relaxed.
Passing this point, the racket head will turn outwards, slicing the shuttle, and the opposing muscles in the forearm will act to slow down the racket.
## Backhand
Similar to the mechanics of the forehand strokes, a backhand stroke uses *supination*.

*Counter-Clockwise Motion, Edit the gif*

There exist a common perception that the forehand strokes are more powerful than backhand strokes. 
This is true in most cases, and the reason is not the difference in *pronation* or *supination*.

The major difference come from the relative position of the shuttle to the body, and how much momentum a player can generate from body movements.
For most forehand shots, the player's body will end up facing the net, so they can play with more confident and worry less about losing balance when using the whole body.
But for rear-court backhand cornors, it is much harder to freely use the body's momentum, thus the shots are weaker.
### Why front-court shots are different
However, experienced players will find that playing a lift or push with the backhand at the *front* of the court is a lot easier than the forehand side.
When the arm swings and the racket closes in, the racket
