#Mechanics of Badminton Strokes#
In this article, we'll discuss how a badminton stroke is executed, including forehand and backhand strokes. 
##What strokes are there?##
There are many types of strokes that a player can play during a game. Most of them can be executed in both forehand and backhand scenarios. A slightly different case exists for around-the-head area, where the arm's motion is similar to forehand's but the body's not. 
Strokes can be categorized based on the spacial alighnemnt with the body. 
On the Z-axis (vertically), there are the following types: upper-hand, mid-hand and lower-hand.
On the Y-axis (front-to-back court), there are front-, cross- and behind-body shots.
And on the X-axis (left-to-right), we have the forehand and backhand shots. (Plus around-the-head)

As human automany has determined how our arms extends and rotates, on the three axis, all shot can be classified as aggresive, neutral and defensive shots.
Aggresive shots usually have more explosive power; the shuttle speed is faster and the landing position control is more precise.
Defensive shots are slower, give more time for the opponent to react and harder to control.
Neutral shots are in between.

At the front of the court, large arm/hand motions can generate high lifts. Small arm/hand motions can generate push and drop shots.
At the middle of the court, drives (fast and flat shots) require more power from the body and the arm, and drop shots usually only need finger power.
At the back of the court, all shots require proper hitting techniques, but the drop shot do not need as much and require more control from the fingers.
##Forehand##
The forehand hitting motion is based on the forearm's pronation (palm turning downwards). This generates the most power and thus accelerate the racket the fastest.
As opposed to some common beliefs that the power comes from the wrist or fingers, the pronation motion generates the most power, and the fingers merely act as a leverage to deliver that power.
The finger techniques are very important, since it is the last link in the dynamic chain, but the generator is actually the forearm.
