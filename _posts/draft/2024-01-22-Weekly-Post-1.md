This is the first post of the new Weekly series where I log at least three important things of a week.

# Subscribed to a new blogger
I started following codercat[INSERT LINK to WEBSITE], who writes about methodology about coding and tech.
He is a contributer to the Rust programming language, and he documented how he started and improved. 

Getting started is almost always the hardest part. 
In fact, you don't need everything ready to get started. Just start somewhere, do something, and then read/study a lot to improve. [Insert reference to John Carmack]

He also mentioned that outputting is a form of reinforced learning. It's the same thing as teaching makes you understand better.
An advice he gave on improving writing is to read a lot, especially the same category you'd want to write about.

His post[LINK to How to Make Money on Medium] introduced a way to make money. Though Medium membership costs a bit, the return can be enormous. Hope to paste a link here to my Medium account soon.
