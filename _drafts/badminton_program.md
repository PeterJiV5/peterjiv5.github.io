# Badminton PC/Console Game
## Why Make This Game?
Badminton is a popular sports among asians, but it requires indoor courts and friends to play with.
This can be challenging sometimes because of unavailability of courts or people.
A digital game, however, can be played virtually anytime, with little to no extra time for setup.
And this game is designed towards high level of competition. Even the top-level athletes can use this game to practice their reflex and tactics.

## Basic Gameplay
The player enters a game as a virtual player, and will be on the court with first-peron-perspective. Keyboard-mouse combo or console controller controls the movement of the player and the shot selection.

# Badminton AI Coach and Analytics Tool
After doing some research, I've found out that it's nearly impossible to acurately model the dynamics of a feather shuttle, thus rendering the game design unreachable(***CHANGE A WORD***)

Instead, I've decided to make an AI tool where I can analyze a player's gameplay.
There are already some [research results](link to Github) on this topic, and they provide a pretty good starting point.

This is also a great opportunity for me to study machine learning and AI.
