January 22nd, 2024 Monday Rain
Today was so depressing. I think the main reason is that my wife constantly tells me that I am wrong, and the idea that I am walking on the wrong path has engrained in my brain.

Just like the movie *Inception*, this idea probably has fundamentally changed how my brain is wired. Speaking of how the brain is wired, the books I'm reading state that most synapses are formed at an early age. It's hard for adults to form new connections, but it's still possible.

I think that after my adulthood, there were two major changes to how my brain was structured. The first time was when I first moved to Canada. The whole new experience definitely changed my mind. 

The second time was in late 2018 and 2019. I read a lot of book at the time, including novels and psychology(***CHECK SPELLING***) books. Those books fundatmentally changed how I view the world.

Back to today's topic, after a few years of inception, I don't think that this *idea* will be easily removed. I will need to resolve to other ways of rebuilding my confidence. 

I think that when I am not at home, I still have some confidence. But as I age, this confidence will very soon wear out, because I am not growing but degenerating.

I need to set a goal and adhere to it. A written goal can really help me achieve what I want.

1. Child education
   a. Read books
   b. Min quality play time each week
   c. Health checks
2.
