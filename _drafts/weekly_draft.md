This is the first post of the new Weekly series where I log at least three important things of a week.

# Codercat: a very good blogger
I started following [Coder's Cat](https://catcoding.me/about/)([English Site](https://coderscat.com/)), who writes about methodology about coding and tech.
He is a contributer to the Rust programming language, and he documented how he started and improved. 

Getting started is almost always the hardest part. 
In fact, you don't need everything ready to get started. Just start somewhere, do something, and then read/study a lot to improve. [Insert reference to John Carmack]

He also mentioned that outputting is a form of reinforced learning. It's the same thing as teaching makes you understand better.
An advice he gave on improving writing is to read a lot, especially the same category you'd want to write about.

His post[LINK to How to Make Money on Medium] introduced a way to make money. Though Medium membership costs a bit, the return can be enormous. Hope to paste a link here to my Medium account soon.

# Badminton/music Project
I thought about making a badminton online/PC/console game. But soon I realized that modelling the shuttle is virtually impossible, thus defeating my goal.
In a draft post, I imagined that I can make a game where the flight path is acurately described so event the top level players can use it to simulate their games. 

Since that is impossible, I am thinking about making an app that can measure some basic performance. For example, number of strokes, types of strokes and shuttle speed, etc. Basically an AI coach (if possible)

Now that AI is widely available, and there are people already making some [AI coaches](https://github.com/wywyWang/CoachAI-Projects), I should take advantage of this resource and develop an app to analyze/track badminton performance. 

# Books: Positive Discipline, Audio Engineer Tutorial
Finished the first three chapters of Positive Discipline (about 15% of the book).
The principles of the book and a child's brain development are introduced.
It gives a scientific understanding of how the brain functions and grows.

I'm reading the Audio Engineer Tutorial book to review some of the basic I've learned.
I hope to deepen my tech knowledge and await the moment of application.
