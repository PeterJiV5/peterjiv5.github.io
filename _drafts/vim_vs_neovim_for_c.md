# Vim vs. NeoVim
When Vim was invented, I'm pretty sure it was made for C programming.
Later, more programming languages have emerged, and the Vim ecosystem is getting left behind.

Nowadays pretty much every code editor relies on plug-ins to achieve(ask AI for a better word) rich features. 
For Vim, plugins are usually written in vimscript, which is known to be hard to develop with. 
NeoVim, on the other hand, uses Lua as the plugin language. Lua is fast and easy to work with.
Therefore NeoVim has a larger plugin store and essencially does things better than Vim.

However, Vim has been there for so long, and NeoVim is pretty much a direct decendent of Vim, there has to be something that Vim is good at.
That thing is **Simplicity**

Honestly, if you don't need that many plugins, you can probably get started with Vim a lot faster.
